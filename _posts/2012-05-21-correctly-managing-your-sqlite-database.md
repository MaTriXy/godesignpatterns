One thing that I've noticed other Android developers having trouble with is properly
setting up their `SQLiteDatabase`. Often times, I come across questions on StackOverflow
asking about error messages such as,

```
E/Database(234): Leak found
E/Database(234): Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: SQLiteDatabase created and never closed
```

As you have probably figured out, this exception is thrown when you have opened more
`SQLiteDatabase` instances than you have closed. Managing the database can be complicated
when first starting out with Android development, especially to those who are just beginning
to understand the `Activity` lifecycle. The easiest solution is to make your database
instance a singleton instance across the entire application's lifecycle. This will ensure
that no leaks occur, and will make your life a lot easier since it eliminates the
possibility of forgetting to close your database as you code.

Here are two examples that illustrates three possible approaches in managing your
singleton database. These will ensure safe access to the database throughout the application.

### Approach #1: Use an Abstract Factory to Instantiate the `SQLiteOpenHelper`

Declare your database helper as a static instance variable and use the Abstract Factory
pattern to guarantee the singleton property. The sample code below should give you a good
idea on how to go about designing the `DatabaseHelper` class correctly.

The static factory `getInstance()` method ensures that only one `DatabaseHelper`
will ever exist at any given time. If the `sInstance` object has not been initialized,
one will be created. If one has already been created then it will simply be returned.
<strong>You should not initialize your helper object using with `new DatabaseHelper(context)`!</strong>
Instead, always use `DatabaseHelper.getInstance(context)`, as it guarantees that only one
database helper will exist across the entire application's lifecycle.

```java
public class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper { 

  private static DatabaseHelper sInstance;

  private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "database_name";
  private static final String DATABASE_TABLE = "table_name";
  private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;

  public static DatabaseHelper getInstance(Context context) {
     
    // Use the application context, which will ensure that you 
    // don't accidentally leak an Activity's context.
    // See this article for more information: http://bit.ly/6LRzfx
    if (sInstance == null) {
      sInstance = new DatabaseHelper(context.getApplicationContext());
    }
    return sInstance;
  }
    
  /**
   * Constructor should be private to prevent direct instantiation.
   * make call to static factory method "getInstance()" instead.
   */
  private DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
    super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
  }
}
```

### Approach #2: Wrap the `SQLiteDatabase` in a `ContentProvider`

This is also a nice approach. For one, the new `CursorLoader` class requires
`ContentProvider`s, so if you want an Activity or Fragment to implement `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>`
with a `CursorLoader` (as discussed in <a href="/2012/07/understanding-loadermanager.html">this post</a>),
you'll need to implement a `ContentProvider` for your application. Further, you don't need to worry
about making a singleton database helper with `ContentProvider`s. Simply call `getContentResolver()`
from the Activity and the system will take care of everything for you (in other words, there is no
need for designing a Singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances from being created).
