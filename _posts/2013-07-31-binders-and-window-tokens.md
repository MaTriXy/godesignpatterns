One of Android's key design goals was to provide an open platform that doesn't rely on a
central authority to verify that applications do what they claim. To achieve this, Android
uses application sandboxes and Linux process isolation to prevent applications from being
able to access the system or other applications in ways that are not controlled and secure.
This architecture was chosen with both developers and device users in mind: neither should
have to take extra steps to protect the device from malicious applications. Everything
should be taken care of automatically by the system.

For a long time I took this security for granted, not completely understanding how it was
actually enforced. But recently I became curious. What mechanism prevents me from, for
example, tricking the system into releasing a wake lock acquired by another application,
or from hiding another application's windows from the screen? More generally, how do
Android's core system services respond to requests made by third-party applications
in a way that is both efficient and secure?

To my surprise, the answer to nearly all of my questions was pretty simple: _the Binder_.
Binders are the cornerstone of Android's architecture; they abstract the low-level details
of IPC from the developer, allowing applications to easily talk to both the System Server
and others' remote service components. But Binders also have a number of other cool features
that are used extensively throughout the system in a mix of clever ways, making it much
easier for the framework to address security issues. This blog post will cover one of
these features in detail, known as _Binder tokens_.

### Binder Tokens

An interesting property of `Binder` objects is that each instance maintains **a unique
identity across all processes in the system**, no matter how many process boundaries
it crosses or where it goes. This facility is provided by the Binder kernel driver, which
analyzes the contents of each Binder transaction and assigns a unique 32-bit integer
value to each `Binder` object it sees. To ensure that Java's `==` operator adheres to
the Binder's unique, cross-process object identity contract, a `Binder`'s object reference
is treated a little differently than those of other objects. Specifically, each `Binder`'s
object reference is assigned either,

  1. A _virtual memory address_ pointing to a `Binder` object in the _same_ process, or
  2. A _unique 32-bit handle_ (as assigned by the Binder kernel driver) pointing to the
     `Binder`'s virtual memory address in a _different_ process.

The Binder kernel driver maintains a mapping of local addresses to remote Binder handles
(and vice versa) for each `Binder` it sees, and assigns each `Binder`'s object reference
its appropriate value to ensure that equality will behave as expected even in remote
processes.

The Binder's unique object identity rules allow them to be used for a special purpose: as
_shared, security access tokens_.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Binders are globally
unique, which means if you create one, nobody else can create one that appears equal to it.
For this reason, the application framework uses Binder tokens extensively in order to ensure
secure interaction between cooperating processes: a client can create a `Binder` object to
use as a token that can be shared with a server process, and the server can use it to validate
the client's requests without there being anyway for others to spoof it.

Let's see how this works through a simple example. Consider an application which makes a
request to the `PowerManager` to acquire (and later release) a wake lock:

```java
/**
 * An example activity that acquires a wake lock in onCreate() 
 * and releases it in onDestroy().
 */
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
    
  private PowerManager.WakeLock wakeLock;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    PowerManager pm = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
    wakeLock = pm.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "My Tag");
    wakeLock.acquire();
  }

  @Override
  protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();

    wakeLock.release();
  }
}
```

Inspecting the `PowerManager`
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-4.3_r2.1/core/java/android/os/PowerManager.java">source code</a>
helps us understand what's happening under the hood (note that some of the source code has been
cleaned-up for the sake of brevity):

```java
/**
 * The interface that applications use to talk to the global power manager
 * system service.
 *
 * @see frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/PowerManager.java
 */
public final class PowerManager {

  // Our handle on the global power manager service.
  private final IPowerManager mService;

  public WakeLock newWakeLock(int levelAndFlags, String tag) {
    return new WakeLock(levelAndFlags, tag);
  }

  public final class WakeLock {
    private final IBinder mToken;
    private final int mFlags;
    private final String mTag;

    WakeLock(int flags, String tag) {
      // Create a token that uniquely identifies this wake lock.
      mToken = new Binder();
      mFlags = flags;
      mTag = tag;
    }

    public void acquire() {
      // Send the power manager service a request to acquire a wake
      // lock for the application. Include the token as part of the 
      // request so that the power manager service can validate the
      // application's identity when it requests to release the wake
      // lock later on.
      mService.acquireWakeLock(mToken, mFlags, mTag);
    }

    public void release() {
      // Send the power manager service a request to release the
      // wake lock associated with 'mToken'.
      mService.releaseWakeLock(mToken);
    }
  }
}
```

So what's going on? Let's walk through the code step-by-step:

  1. The client application requests an instance of the `PowerManager` class in `onCreate()`.
     The `PowerManager` class provides an interface for the client application to talk to the global
     <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-4.3_r2.1/services/java/com/android/server/power/PowerManagerService.java">`PowerManagerService`</a>,
     which runs in the System Server process and is in charge of managing the device's power
     state (i.e. determining the screen's brightness, starting Daydreams, detecting when the
     device is plugged into a dock, etc.).

  2. The client application creates and acquires a wake lock in `onCreate()`. The `PowerManager`
     sends the `WakeLock`'s unique `Binder` token as part of the `acquire()` request. When the
     `PowerManagerService` receives the request, it holds onto the token for safe-keeping and
     forces the device to remain awake, until...

  3. The client application releases the wake lock in `onDestroy()`. The `PowerManager` sends
     the `WakeLock`'s unique `Binder` token as part of the request. When the `PowerManagerService`
     receives the request, it compares the token against all other `WakeLock` tokens it has stored,
     and only releases the `WakeLock` if it finds a match. This additional "validation step" is an
     important security measure put in place to guarantee that other applications cannot trick the
     `PowerManagerService` into releasing a `WakeLock` held by a different application.

Because of their unique object-identity capabilities, Binder tokens are used
extensively<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> in the system for security. Perhaps the most
interesting example of how they are used in the framework is the "window token," which we will now
discuss below.

### Window Tokens

If you've ever scrolled through the official documentation for Android's `View` class, chances
are you've stumbled across the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#getWindowToken()">`getWindowToken()`</a>
method and wondered what it meant. As its name implies, a window token is a special type of
Binder token that the window manager uses to uniquely identify a window in the system. Window
tokens are important for security because they make it impossible for malicious applications
to draw on top of the windows of other applications. The window manager protects against this
by requiring applications to pass their application's window token as part of each request to
add or remove a window.<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> If the tokens don't match, the
window manager rejects the request and throws a
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.BadTokenException.html">`BadTokenException`</a>.
Without window tokens, this necessary identification step wouldn't be possible and the window
manager wouldn't be able to protect itself from malicious applications.

By this point you might be wondering about the real-world scenarios in which you would need to
obtain a window token. Here are some examples:

  + When an application starts up for the first time, the `ActivityManagerService`<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
    creates a special kind of window token called an **application window token**, which uniquely identifies the application's
    top-level container window.<sup><a href="#footnote5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> The activity manager gives this token to both the
    application and the window manager, and the application sends the token to the window manager each time it wants to
    add a new window to the screen. This ensures secure interaction between the application and the window manager
    (by making it impossible to add windows on top of other applications), and also makes it easy for the activity
    manager to make direct requests to the window manager. For example, the activity manager can say, "hide all of
    this token's windows", and the window manager will be able to correctly identify the set of windows which should be closed.

  + Developers implementing their own custom Launchers can interact with the live wallpaper window that sits directly behind them by calling the 
    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/WallpaperManager.html#sendWallpaperCommand(android.os.IBinder, java.lang.String, int, int, int, android.os.Bundle)">`sendWallpaperCommand(IBinder windowToken, String action, int x, int y, int z, Bundle extras)`</a>
    method. To ensure that no other application other than the Launcher is able to interact with the live wallpaper, the
    framework requires developers to pass a window token as the first argument to the method. If the window token does not
    identify the current foreground activity window sitting on top of the wallpaper, the command is ignored and a warning is logged.

  + Applications can ask the
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/inputmethod/InputMethodManager.html">`InputMethodManager`</a>
    to hide the soft keyboard by calling the
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/inputmethod/InputMethodManager.html#hideSoftInputFromWindow(android.os.IBinder, int)">`hideSoftInputFromWindow(IBinder windowToken, int flags)`</a>
    method, but must provide a window token as part of the request. If the token doesn't match the window token belonging to the
    window currently accepting input, the `InputMethodManager` will reject the request. This makes it impossible for malicious
    applications to force-close a soft keyboard opened by another application.

  + Applications which manually add new windows to the screen (i.e. using the
    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.html">`addView(View, WindowManager.LayoutParams)`</a>
    method) may need to specify their application's window token by setting the
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#token">`WindowManager.LayoutParams.token`</a>
    field. It is very unlikely that any normal application would ever have to do this, since the
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#getWindowManager()">`getWindowManager()`</a>
    method returns a `WindowManager` which will automatically set the token's value for you. That said, if at some point
    in the future you encounter a situation in which you need to add a panel window to the screen from a background
    service, know that you would need to manually sign the request with your application window token in order to achieve it. :P

### Conclusion

Though their existence is for the most part hidden from developers, Binder tokens are used
extensively in the system for security. Android is a massively distributed system of cooperating
processes reliant on the fact that Binder objects are unique across all processes on the device.
Binder tokens are the driving force behind interaction in the framework, and without them secure
communication between application processes and the system would be difficult to achieve.

and chances are it makes use of Binder tokens in some shape or form. Another cool example involves
the status bar, notification manager, and the system UI. Specifically, the
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/services/java/com/android/server/StatusBarManagerService.java">`StatusBarManagerService`</a>
maintains a global mapping of Binder tokens to notifications. When the
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/services/java/com/android/server/NotificationManagerService.java">`NotificationManagerService`</a>
makes a request to the status bar manager to add a notification to the status bar, the status bar
manager creates a binder token uniquely identifying the notification and passes it to both the
notification manager and the
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/packages/SystemUI/">`SystemUI`</a>.
Since all three parties know the notification's Binder token, any changes to the notification from
that point forward (i.e. the notification manager cancels the notification, or the SystemUI detects
that the user has swiped a notification off screen) will go through the status bar manager first.
This makes it easier for the three system services to stay in sync: the status bar manager can be
in charge of centralizing all of the information about which notifications should currently be shown
without the SystemUI and notification manager ever having to interact with each other directly. <a href="#ref2" title="Jump to footnote 2.">&#8617;</a>
