Consider the following code:

<div class="scrollable">
{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public class SampleActivity extends Activity {

  private final Handler mLeakyHandler = new Handler() {
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
      // ... 
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

While not readily obvious, this code can cause cause a massive memory leak.
Android Lint will give the following warning: 

> In Android, Handler classes should be static or leaks might occur.

But where exactly is the leak and how might it happen? Let's determine the
source of the problem by first documenting what we know:

<!--more-->

  1. When an Android application first starts, the framework creates a 
     <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper.html">`Looper`</a>
     object for the application's main thread. A `Looper` implements a simple message queue,
     processing <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Message.html">`Message`</a>
     objects in a loop one after another. All major application framework events (such
     as Activity lifecycle method calls, button clicks, etc.) are contained inside
     `Message` objects, which are added to the `Looper`'s message queue and are processed
     one-by-one. The main thread's `Looper` exists throughout the application's lifecycle.

  2. When a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html">`Handler`</a>
     is instantiated on the main thread, it is associated with the `Looper`'s message queue.
     Messages posted to the message queue will hold a reference to the `Handler` so that the
     framework can call
     <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html#handleMessage(android.os.Message)">`Handler#handleMessage(Message)`</a>
     when the `Looper` eventually processes the message.

  3. In Java, non-static inner and anonymous classes hold an implicit reference to their
     outer class. Static inner classes, on the other hand, do not.

So where exactly is the memory leak? It's very subtle, but consider the following code as an example:

<div class="scrollable">
{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public class SampleActivity extends Activity {
 
  private final Handler mLeakyHandler = new Handler() {
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
      // ...
    }
  }
 
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
 
    // Post a message and delay its execution for 10 minutes.
    mLeakyHandler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() { }
    }, 60 * 10 * 1000);
 
    // Go back to the previous Activity.
    finish();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

When the activity is finished, the delayed message will continue to live in the main thread's
message queue for 10 minutes before it is processed. The message holds a reference to the
activity's `Handler`, and the `Handler` holds an implicit reference to its outer class (the
`SampleActivity`, in this case). This reference will persist until the message is processed,
thus preventing the activity context from being garbage collected and leaking all of the
application's resources. Note that the same is true with the anonymous Runnable class on
line 15. Non-static instances of anonymous classes hold an implicit reference to their outer
class, so the context will be leaked.

To fix the problem, subclass the `Handler` in a new file or use a static inner class instead.
Static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class, so the activity
will not be leaked. If you need to invoke the outer activity's methods from within the
`Handler`, have the Handler hold a `WeakReference` to the activity so you don't accidentally
leak a context. To fix the memory leak that occurs when we instantiate the anonymous Runnable
class, we make the variable a static field of the class (since static instances of anonymous
classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class):

<div class="scrollable">
{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public class SampleActivity extends Activity {

  /**
   * Instances of static inner classes do not hold an implicit
   * reference to their outer class.
   */
  private static class MyHandler extends Handler {
    private final WeakReference<SampleActivity> mActivity;

    public MyHandler(SampleActivity activity) {
      mActivity = new WeakReference<SampleActivity>(activity);
    }

    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
      SampleActivity activity = mActivity.get();
      if (activity != null) {
        // ...
      }
    }
  }

  private final MyHandler mHandler = new MyHandler(this);

  /**
   * Instances of anonymous classes do not hold an implicit
   * reference to their outer class when they are "static".
   */
  private static final Runnable sRunnable = new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() { }
  };

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Post a message and delay its execution for 10 minutes.
    mHandler.postDelayed(sRunnable, 60 * 10 * 1000);
    
    // Go back to the previous Activity.
    finish();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

The difference between static and non-static inner classes is subtle, but is something
every Android developer should understand. What's the bottom line? Avoid using non-static
inner classes in an activity if instances of the inner class outlive the activity's
lifecycle. Instead, prefer static inner classes and hold a weak reference to the activity inside.
