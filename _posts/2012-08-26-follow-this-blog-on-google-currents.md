Hi all,

I've recently made this blog available on Google Currents! Install the application and
subscribe by clicking [this link](https://www.google.com/producer/editions/CAow5Ir3AQ/android_design_patterns).

If you have never used Google Currents, I strongly recommend that you try it out. It's a
really great way to keep up with the latest news, blogs, and your favorite Google+ streams,
and it works seamlessly offline (which I've found is great for long plane rides). If you're
a long time Flipboard user, I recommend you give it a try as well... in my opinion, Currents
is easier to navigate and feels much more like a native Android application. That said,
I do tend to be a bit biased towards the native Google apps. :P

As always, don't hesitate to leave a comment if you find a bug or have any suggestions on
how I can improve the edition! I'm going to try really hard to keep it up-to-date for those
of you who follow this blog and can't get enough of Google Currents!

Cheers,<br>
Alex
