<p>Hi, my name's Alex. I'm a passionate Android developer and a huge fan of design patterns.</p>

<p>As a contributor to several open-source projects and an <a href="{{ site.author.stackoverflow }}">active user</a>
on StackOverflow, I've encountered too many applications that suffer due to poor
code design. Organizing the code that makes up your Android project can be a challenge,
but it is essential when writing an application that can be easily extended and maintained
in the future.</p>

<p>The goal of this blog is simple: to encourage proper coding practices when it comes
to Android development. The blog posts range from in-depth tutorials to casual rants
on Android-related topics. I hope that each post will give you with a better understanding
as to why proper code design in Android development is so important.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment!
