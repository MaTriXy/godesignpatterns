## Find a typo?

If you find a typo, please feel free to suggest a correction yourself by submitting a pull request! All published posts are written in standard markdown format and can be found in the [`_posts/`](/_posts) directory. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, the easiest way to suggest a fix is to:

1. Navigate to the [`_posts/`](/_posts) directory and click on the post that contains the error.
2. Click **Edit** and update the post with your proposed correction.
3. Write a _detailed_ commit summary and description (if necessary) and click **Propose File Change**.
4. Click **Send pull request** on the following page. I'll review the correction as soon as I can!

Thanks in advance!
